        <p> The girl kept on walking and watching the glass slipper. It was so shiny! Few moments later she came to little town. There were few street markets - clothes, food, furniture. She saw one shop with old decorations, accessories and furniture. She thought maybe there someone could tell her anything about glass slipper. Next to the shop was sitting a poor girl with few matches. </p>
