      <center><p>Woman was very welcome and she made a tasty tea with delicious biscuits. She was talking a lot about her life same as was asking a lot of questions about the girl. But the woman was nice and honest. She told the story how other children tried to eat her house... <br> After an hour of warm talking the girl decided carry on her journey and say bye to the woman. She got a bit sad as she wanted her to stay more, however, she prepared a basket of sweets, biscuits and fruits for a girl so she can have it if she will get hungry.</p></center>
