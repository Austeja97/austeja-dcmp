        <p>At that moment something moved in the water. The girl stopped crying and start staring in the water. Suddenly, a girl popped out of the water! It was a mermaid: "Hey, your tears woke me up... Why are you crying little girl?" The girl told her story and she mentioned that there is a river near her house. Mermaid felt sorry for her: "Wait for me here. Don't go anywhere." In few moments she brought a boat: "Let's find your home. This river has just one branch." The girl got happy and she jumped to the boat. It didn't take a while when she was near her house and she came back safely.</p>
